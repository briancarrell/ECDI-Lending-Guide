/* 
contentArray is an array, or an ordered folder, of objects.
To make a new array, you say var name = [object0, object1, etc.];
This specific one has smaller arrays inside of the main array (similar to nested folders).
This is written as var contentArray = [Folder0[object0, etc], Folder1[object0], etc].
It is important to note that arrays start at 0, so the first object listed in a folder has an
index of 0.

To add a page, copy and paste this inside the array:

// Page Title
    'Page Title': {
        'Index': #,
        'File Path': "<p class='filePath'>Folder Title > Page Title</p>",
        'Page Title': "<h1 id='pageTitle'>Page Title</h1>",
        'Page Content': "<p>Insert Text Here</p><br><br><br>"
    },

You can then replace the info with the actual contents you want to add.
Index should be in numerical order according to the order in the navigation.
You will need to change the index value of other pages if you want to add a page in the middle
of the navigation.  If you do this, simply increase the index value of all pages after the new one
by the number of new pages you add.

Here is some basic HTML info to help you add new content.
If this doesn't make sense, you can look at w3schools.com to help you.

<h> tags are used for Titles and range anywhere from <h1> to <h6>, with <h1> being the largest.
<p> tags are for paragraphs, and print the same as a normal paragraph.
<img> tags are for images and require a src (source image) attribute that is the same as the image
file.

All tags must have an "end tag" at the end of them, which is the same as the opening tag,
but with a / before the >. For example, a <p> tag must have a </p> after the text you want inside
of it.

To make a table, there are a few more steps:
<table> is the overall table.
<tr> is a table row.
<td> is a cell of the row.
So a table with two rows and three columns would look like this:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Text</td>
        <td>Text</td>
        <td>Text</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Text</td>
        <td>Text</td>
        <td>Text</td>
    </tr>
</table>


Lists can be either ordered or unordered.
<ol> tags are for ordered lists and can have type="" A, a, I, i, or 1.
<ul> tags are for unordered lists (bullet points).
Each list item must also be inside an <li></li> tag.
Lists can be nested by placing the <ol> or <ul> tag inside an <li> tag.

<br> tags are used to create an empty line.
These are helpful for keeping text away from the bottom of the page, or spacing out elements.

When you add anything to the array, the whole item must still be in quotations,
and there can't be any line breaks between elements (just type it all on one line).
If it is all orange, you did it right!

The insurance coverage goes toward paying fees and costs of litigating the liability incurred by the business. This obviously helps our client avoid financial ruin and continue paying down the loan (by not having to pay the judgment and fees) so it should be required of most borrowers.</p><br><br><br>"

        'Page Content': "<p>Automobile Insurance – simply to differentiate from the other types of insurance (as everyone should be familiar with auto insurance) this type only covers particular kinds of events concerning a personal automobile, usually an accident, and pays for the car damage and injuries associated of those involved up to the policy limit. Any clients using personal automobiles as collateral will need to provide auto insurance and name ECDI as a loss payee.</p><p>The important part is that personal auto insurance primarily covers the vehicle for an individual using it as personal transport. So if the driver is using it primarily for his or her business (making deliveries, transporting passengers, etc.) then private insurance may not cover the vehicle in the event of an accident. In particular, prospective Uber or Lyft drivers in Ohio will need to obtain Rideshare Insurance or Rideshare Endorsement on the personal auto policy. An in-depth explanation of Rideshare Insurance can be found here: <a href='http://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/uber-insurance.aspx'>http://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/uber-insurance.aspx</a></p><p>Other kinds of businesses using vehicles will want to obtain Businessowner’s Automobile Insurance discussed above as personal auto insurance will not protect the business if the injured third party (the person injured in an accident with the business’s vehicle) decides to sue the business. It should be noted that if the automobile is used primarily for business purposes, then the business owner will need only obtain Businessowner’s Auto Insurance as that policy will likely cover the “grey area” of personal use. If the vehicle is primarily for personal use and sometimes used for the business, then the owner’s personal auto insurance should have a commercial liability endorsement.</p><p>An additional wrinkle with automobile insurance concerns trucking clients. Trucking clients must be evaluated based on whether they operate on their own authority (technical term in the trucking industry) or whether they are contract drivers.  Trucking clients who operate their own authority, called Independent Owner-Operators, can haul goods on their own licensure absent outside contracting, though they will typically contract with a supplier to deliver goods. Independent Owner-Operators require all federal and state licensure required for the kinds of loads they intend to deliver, in addition to possessing their own Commercial Auto Insurance. Primary liability coverage amount for the truck and cargo or secondary liability (truck with no trailer) endorsements are examples of complications that should be discussed if a client is operating under their own authority.</p><p>The positive side of trucking insurance is if the client is operating as an Owner-Operator (non-independent), then the contracting company whose authority the client is operating under is required by FMSCA to supply the primary liability and cargo insurance coverage. The contractor however may charge the client for these mandatory provisions. In this case the Owner-Operator client need only maintain primary damage insurance for his or her truck. In either case however, ECDI should acquire some proof of primary and secondary insurance for its trucking clients.</p><br><br><br>"

Same goes for Property Insurance for a business.
